# LIVE-PROJECT

LENDAR APP - Lendar is a peer 2 peer lending app for friends and acquaintance. 

# MOTIVATION
This project was inspired by the need to help friends and family get access to interest free credit facility. Most people cannot afford to go through the herculean process involved in seeking for loan from a bank and sometimes the interest rate is a burden. Lendar's mission is to grant these disadvantaged set of people access to loans from their close friends or family members completely free of interest. The app also provides a re-negotiation option for both parties.
